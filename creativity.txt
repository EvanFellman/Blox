The elements Tetris has detailed as its distinctive trade dress are:

- "Geometric playing pieces formed by four equally-sized, delineated blocks;"
- "The long vertical rectangle playing field, which is higher than wide;"
- "The downward, lateral and rotating movements of the playing pieces;"
- "The appearance of a shadow piece at the bottom of the playing field \
matrix to indicate where the Tetrimino will drop;"
- "The appearance of a trailer effect after the Tetrimino during a 'hard \
drop' command;"
- "The display of the next Tetrimino that will fall down the matrix in a \
small box next to the playing field;"
- "The disappearance of any completed horizontal line;"
- "The display of a flash effect when a completed horizontal line disappears;" and
- "The subsequent consolidation of the playing pieces remaining on the playing \
field as a result of the downward shift into the space vacated by the disappearing line."

IDEAS:

5 block pieces, no hold, no next piece, two piece choices at the top (pick via arrow,\
piece not chosen stays), the bottom row has lost a corner on both sides thus making it\
an octagon, powerups: bomb, shake to left/right removing gaps, outline of where piece\
will fall

ITEMS REMAINING FROM TETRIS:
- "The disappearance of any completed horizontal line;"
- "The subsequent consolidation of the playing pieces remaining on the playing \
field as a result of the downward shift into the space vacated by the disappearing line."
- "The downward, lateral and rotating movements of the playing pieces;"
